The Department of Ornithology conducts research in behavioural ecology of birds.

We ask how sexual selection acts as a driver of biodiversity. We study the processes that underlie sexual selection and their consequences for the evolution of behavioural and life-history traits. Our work is characterized by technology-assisted behavioural observations on large numbers of individuals in free-living populations, complemented by observations on captive individuals, and a quantitative approach using state-of-the-art statistical methods. We also conduct comparative analyses to test hypotheses about the evolution of key phenotypic traits. To this end, we maintain and develop a [database](/CONTENT/projects/Macroecology/) that links life-history traits of the world&#39;s 10,000 bird species with environmental and ecological data. 

Birds are powerful and tractable systems for understanding the astonishing diversity of adaptations encountered in the wild. A key aim of our work is to reveal which traits are affected by sexual selection, i.e. relevant for mate choice and for successful competition for mating. We study a variety of species with [different mating systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982222010314) and consider both obvious candidate traits such as parental care, colour and song characteristics, but also less obvious ones such as seasonal and daily timing of behaviour, activity and sleep, and dispersal and site fidelity. 

The Department of Ornithology is a highly international group of behavioural ecologists led by [Prof. Dr. Bart Kempenaers](https://www.bi.mpg.de/2403173/kempenaers-page) , who is scientific director of the [Max Planck Institute of Biological Intelligence](https://www.bi.mpg.de/en) (formerly the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology) in Seewiesen, Germany since 2003, and honorary professor in behavioural ecology at the [Ludwig Maximilian University](https://www.lmu.de/en/) in Munich, Germany since 2004.

On this website you can find out more about [our projects](/projects.html), [who we are](/CONTENT/Team), [what we have published](/CONTENT/publications/) and who supports our work. Videos and photos will give you a taste of our fieldwork. Our work is driven by wonder about birds and their behaviour, by the enjoyment of studying birds in beautiful locations and by the pleasure of collaborating with amazing colleagues. Let this website be your guide. And feel free to ask questions.
