A video recording of a Daurian redstart nest from a population in NE China showed that a common cuckoo ejected all the host nestlings. When the redstart then produced a new nest, it was parasitized by the cuckoo. These observations provide circumstantial evidence for “farming behaviour” by a brood parasite.
