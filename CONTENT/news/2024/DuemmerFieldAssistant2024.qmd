For our ongoing study on the reproductive biology of a population of northern lapwings in Northern Germany, we are seeking to hire a full-time field assistant from 17 February to 30 June 2025. Work will include nest searching and monitoring, catching, measuring, and banding adult birds and their offspring, as well as behavioural observations. If you have extensive and demonstrable experience in these activities, love field work, and enjoy working in an international team, check out our ad for more information and apply online here the latest by 15 December 2024.

After 6 years of working on shorebird microbiome projects as a (part-time) post-doc, Hanna Prüter is leaving us to take up a new position as scientific coordinator for the LIFE IP GrassBirdHabitats (https://www.grassbirdhabitats.eu/). Hanna will work alongside Heinrich Belting and his team at the project’s Lower Saxony Water Management, Coastal and Nature Protection Agency (NLWKN) branch, with the goal to protect meadow birds by conserving and restoring their wet grassland habitats. Congratulations and all best wishes to Hanna. We look forward to meeting her again soon amongst the lapwings nesting in the Lake Dümmer wetlands.
