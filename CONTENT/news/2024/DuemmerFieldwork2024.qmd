In close collaboration with Dr. Heinrich Belting and his team from the Lower Saxony Water Management, Coastal Defence and Nature Conservation Agency, our group studied a breeding population of Northern lapwings (*Vanellus vanellus*) in a moorland north of Lake DÃ¼mmer between April and June 2024. We found 212 nests, collected samples for parentage and microbiome analyses, and equipped 64 females and 30 males with GPS tags.
