After 13 years in our group, it is time to say goodbye to Martin Bulla. This autumn he will move to the Department of Ecology at the Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague. Martin did his PhD with us on _biparental incubation in shorebirds_, with a study on socially monogamous semipalmated sandpipers in Alaska and with further comparative work. As a follow-up, his post-doc project focused on _patterns of uniparental incubation_ in shorebirds. Martin will now be funded by the Faculty of Environmental Sciences through its Research Excellence program. He plans to establish a group exploring global patterns of traits related to fear, communication and reproduction.
