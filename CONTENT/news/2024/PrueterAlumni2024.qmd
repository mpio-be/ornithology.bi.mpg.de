After 6 years of working on shorebird microbiome projects as a (part-time) post-doc, Hanna Prüter is leaving us to take up a new position as scientific coordinator for the [LIFE IP GrassBirdHabitats](https://www.grassbirdhabitats.eu/). Hanna will work alongside Heinrich Belting and his team at the project’s Lower Saxony Water Management, Coastal and Nature Protection Agency (NLWKN) branch, with the goal to protect meadow birds by conserving and restoring their wet grassland habitats. Congratulations and all best wishes to Hanna. We look forward to meeting her again soon amongst the lapwings nesting in the Lake Dümmer wetlands.
