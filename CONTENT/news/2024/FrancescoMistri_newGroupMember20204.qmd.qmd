We are thrilled to have Francesco Mistri join our team as a Data Scientist. Francesco, a recent graduate from the University of Bologna with a Master's in Artificial Intelligence, brings a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for machine learning. His expertise in Python, C++, PyTorch, and computer vision, combined with his experience in open-source collaboration, will be invaluable for our team. We are excited to work with Francesco. His skills and dedication will bring some innovative approaches to study behaviour and he undoubtedly will contribute to many ongoing and future projects.
