After studying the movements and the mating behaviour of polygynous pectoral sandpipers and polyandrous red phalaropes for his PhD, Hannes is now moving himself. He will start a post-doctoral position with Dr. Allert Bijleveld at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) on Texel to study the causes and consequences of shorebird movement and habitat selection in the Wadden Sea. We wish Hannes smooth sailing and a tailwind on his daily commute by bike.
