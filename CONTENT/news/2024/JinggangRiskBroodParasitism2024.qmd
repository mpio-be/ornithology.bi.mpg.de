The risk of brood parasitism may be expected to affect the costs and benefits of extra-pair copulations in host species, and thus levels of extra-pair paternity. Nonetheless, through a mix of filed observations and experimental manipulations in a population of Daurian redstarts, we found no relationship between parasitism risk and levels of extra-pair paternity. This suggests that in this species, the risk of brood parasitism does not impact the occurrence of extra-pair paternity.
