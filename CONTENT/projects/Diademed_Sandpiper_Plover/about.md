*The mysterious movements of the Diademed Sandpiper Plover*


The Diademed Sandpiper Plover ("DSP") is a charismatic shorebird inhabiting the high Andes of South America. Despite the species' iconic status for ecotourists and ornithologists worldwide, surprisingly little is known about the annual movements of DSP throughout the continent. Current understanding of DSP life history suggests that breeding activities are limited to high elevation (\>2500 m) brackish or freshwater wetlands often fed by thermal springs. Although these wetlands experience freezing temperatures, high winds, and/or snowfall over the winter, no DSP have been observed at lower elevations on the Andean Pacific slope, suggesting that DSP remain sedentary at high elevation wetlands or migrate to unidentified regions of the continent. To solve this ornithological mystery, our project uses state-of-the-art animal tracking technology at two breeding sites spanning the central core and southern limit of the species' range: Lagunas de Vilama, Argentina, and the El Yeso Valley, Chile.
