*Nomadism*

Birds are renowned for their remarkable movements spanning vast distances across the globe. Migration – the seasonal transitions between breeding and non-breeding locations – is a well-known phenomenon that fascinates both scientists and the general public. 
The phenomenon of nomadism is less known and understudied. Nomadic movements can take place during any time of the year, including the breeding season. Nomadic individuals typically move without a clear pattern in terms of direction or distance. Nomadism can function to explore potential breeding sites and can be driven by environmental factors, such as nest or food availability, or by social dynamics, such as local competition and availability of mates. Some species are nomadic only during a particular stage of their life history.
Our research focuses on nomadic behaviour in shorebirds
