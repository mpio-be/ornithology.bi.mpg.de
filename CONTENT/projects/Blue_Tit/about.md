*The Blue Tit study system*

Blue tits – familiar garden birds to most Europeans – typically breed as a socially monogamous pair, that is, one male and one female that raise a brood together. However, about half of the nests contain one or more offspring sired by another than the social male who is caring for the brood (extra-pair paternity). Moreover, some males are mated with two or – rarely – three females (social polygyny). Our research aims to understand the mating behaviour and its evolutionary consequences. Why do some males sire extra-pair young and others not? Why do females copulate with males other than their social mate? Why do particular males and females form a social pair? Why are some males paired with more than one female? Why do some individuals breed with the same partner in different years while others ‘divorce’?
